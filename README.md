# WeLD
Web Lattice Dynamics: atomic motion in crystals, in a browser

Preview of `master` branch `index.html`:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aephil/WeLD/blob/master/index.html

## Running the code
First, install the required npm modules:
`npm install --dev`
Run the http server with the command `npm start`

## Unit tests
Unit tests for key bits of code should be put index
`tests/someDirectory/testFileNumberOne.test.js`.
To run the tests, run `npm test` from your terminal.
Unit testing is currently very hacky; see
issue https://github.com/aephil/WeLD/issues/20,
and particularly the discussion in this pull request:
https://github.com/aephil/WeLD/pull22/
